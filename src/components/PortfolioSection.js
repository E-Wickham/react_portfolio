                    It takes JSON data from the API of a podcast hosting service and uses it to dynamically generate web pages for each individual podcast episode. 
                    This brings listeners away from the podcast hosting site and into the podcasterâ€™s own domain, allowing them to create spaces for advertisers, 
                    links to their Patreon, and establish/reinforce brand standards for their product. 
                    This code is usable by anyone with a buzzsprout API authentication 
                    token, and can be used to dynamically generate webpages for each individual piece of audio published on the podcast host's buzzsprout account. 
                    This is great for Search Engine Optimization as well as building authority for your podcast, as it takes away any negative connotations 
                    (specifically about production quality) associated with using a placeholder site created by Buzzsprout."
