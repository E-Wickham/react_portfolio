# My favourite part of my job is also a serious problem. 
July 14, 2024

Apologies in advance, I'm going to be talking about work. 

Yeah I know, work is boring. It's not interesting, "nobody wants to hear about it Eric." I understand, I just don't care, I've got some things to say.

So for those of you who are not paying attention to the latest developments in my career, here's a quick rundown.

I landed a big grant last year to do data journalism for The Hoser, I took my podcast production to another level, and I helped build a website to promote journalism created by independent news orgs in the fallout of Bill C-18. That website just received funding to keep me around for two years to make sure the site works properly. It's great.

I made a promise to myself about four years ago to find a way to make my career feel less nightmarish. We spend a good chunk of our lives working and although I appreciate some people's cynical approach to their careers (get paid, don't stress, live on the weekends), I don't think I'm built like that. 

My first full time job out of journalism school was an on-air position at a small market radio station in cottage country. It should have been a dream job for so many reasons, but I don't think any job has ever made me as miserable. I think anyone who works in a field they're passionate about knows what I'm talking about when I say it was a place that used your passion and naivete as leverage against you. They'd remind you how lucky you were to be working in radio, and they found new, inventive ways of taking fun out of a completely unserious job. 

It was a joke. Nobody I worked with is at that station anymore, which is a complete indictment of the upper management at the station. Of the six people I worked with four are working in different fields, and two have passed away. 

That station was an incredible lesson for me, even the most casual, "fun" jobs can become unbearable if you don't understand what makes them good. I've had comms gigs for organizations in the past that were very boring that I enjoyed much, much more than being on the radio. 

I'm sort of dealing with a different problem now though. I love what I do, I just don't know exactly how to define it.

Toronto is a weird place where "what do you do for work" is a conversation that comes up more often than you think. People love talking about work, but I still haven't figured out the quickest way to explain what I do.

I've been called a podcaster, journalist, data journalist, software developer, entrepreneur (lol), but those are all wrong. The problem with working in 2024 is that old ways of thinking about work don't really apply. I don't have a role that fits anything that would have come up as your top result in a quiz during Careers class. 

More importantly, I think when I'm on the lookout for more clients it can be confusing to them when my portfolio has writing, audio production and web development work in it. I don't think some people know what to make of it, and I think other people think I'm just a hack fraud of a developer or producer. The biggest part of selling someone on your services as a professional is making them trust that you're competent enough to get the job done, and I think being an interdisciplinary professional can muddy the waters a bit for potential clients. 

That being said, we all have to be swiss army knives in the current journalism industry. Most freelancers I know do contract work for unions or hospitals or non-profits on the side. They need to keep the lights on somehow. Those freelancers do this side work because they want to write though. 

I do these different kinds of work because I love that it keeps me on my toes. There's nothing more exhausting then doing the same thing for 40 hours a week with no break. It's soul-destroying. 

Every day for me is a new experience. Ok, it's still work, and work is less fun than not working. But I actually feel present when I work now. I'm not going through the motions hoping for my day to end a little faster. I haven't checked out a single time. 

Not everyone gets to pick what they want to do for work. Whether they're limited by responsibilities, socio-economic realities, or ability to do the work, it's a rare thing for a person to be able to go "I want to do this" and then go and do that exact thing. By some stroke of luck, I'm actually doing that. It's wild.

I just need a name for it I guess.
